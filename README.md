## Stack
-------------------
*We inherited all the methods from Singly Linked List. The only difference is that we were more explicit with our *pop()* method to work for the stack. In case the stack is empty, the method raises an *IndexError*.

### Push
*The *push()* method pushes a new Node into a stack. This stack uses FILO, which is First In Last Out.
The Time Complexity for this method is 0(1). Time is constant because you do not have to iterate through the list.

* Time Complexity = O(1)

### Pop
*The *pop()* method removes a new Node off the top of the stack. This stack uses FILO, which is First In Last Out.
The Time Complexity for this method is 0(1). Time is constant because you do not have to iterate through the list.

* Time Complexity = O(1)
