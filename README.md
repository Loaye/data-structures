## Stack
-------------------
### Push
The *push()* method pushes a new Node into a stack. This stack uses FILO, which is First In Last Out.
The Time Complexity for this method is 0(1). Time is constant because you do not have to iterate through the list.

### Pop
The *pop()* method removes a new Node off the top of the stack. This stack uses FILO, which is First In Last Out.
The Time Complexity for this method is 0(1). Time is constant because you do not have to iterate through the list.
